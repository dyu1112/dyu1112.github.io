    <p>
        Catch monsters hidden amongst trick-or-treaters on Halloween night. Interrogate visitors based on
        suspicious quirks of their appearance. Appease kids by giving them candy, and make sure not to anger their parents! Pick through the hordes of sugar-high children and identify monsters using their weaknesses. See right through ghosts with a flashlight and make vampires gag with unappetizing garlic before trapping them in your patented monster-proof cage.

    <h3>Animalese-esque Dialogue Blips</h3>
    <p>
        Inspired by Animal Crossing's fictional animalese language. In Unity, in an OnCharacterTyped()
        function in conjunction with Yarn Spinner's typewriter effect, Unity would send the character typed
        and the NPC who spoke it to Wwise through Wwise Switches. Using that information, Wwise
        would retrieve the sound for that character corresponding to that NPC and play it, creating the
        illusion of animalese.
    </p>
    <p>
        To support the player's objective in differentiating between monsters and kids, in Wwise, monster dialogue blips
        would be pitched to be lower and less fluctuating to sound less humanlike while kid dialogue blips would
        fluctuate in pitch in a higher range.
